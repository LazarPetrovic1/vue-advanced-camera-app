# Vue camera app

A thought experiment application (simple exercise)

Taking, deleting, editing and looking images up is supported

Cross-platform to be tested (developed?)

## Installing dependencies

```bash
# From the root folder
$ npm i && npm run clientinstall
```

```bash
# From root and client
$ npm i
$ cd client/
$ npm i
```

### Running the app

# From the root folder
$ npm run dev
```

Enjoy ^_^
